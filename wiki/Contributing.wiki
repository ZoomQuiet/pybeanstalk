= Contributing =
This is a pretty standard open-source project. Contributions are always welcome and desired.  A few guidelines/requests for contributors are outlined below.

== Code ==
If you would like to contribute code to this project, please do so in the form of a unified diff that I can apply with patch. If you need assistance with this let me know.  If you are a project member, you can just submit to svn :).

Please:
 * roughly follow [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8]
 * be willing to explain your code if I ask

== Bugs ==
 * Pease use the googlecode [http://code.google.com/p/pybeanstalk/issues/list issue tracker] for this project
 * If possible include the generated error, and how to reproduce it

== Documentation ==
I think Googlecode currently only allows project members to edit wiki pages, so email me documentation and I will add/edit the appropriate page. If I'm wrong about my above assumption, edit away!

== Other ==
If there are other ways of contributing I havent mentioned above, email me about them.

= Licensing =
Currently pybeanstalk is listed as a GPL v3 project.  I will most likely be changing this to a dual licensing, GPL v3 and BSD scheme in the near future.  Contributing code to this project for inclusion implies that you agree with this decision.
