Thank you for your interest in pybeanstalk. The copy of the source code
you've received by svn co ... is old and outdated.  As of 10-24-2008 repository
for pybeanstalk is hosted on github.  Official releases, bug tracking, and wiki
pages are still available and current on the pybeanstalk googlecode page.

The new github repo page is located at:
http://github.com/sophacles/pybeanstalk/tree/master

If you would like help updating your local repo copy, feel free to email me.

Thanks,

Erich
